    "# Exercise 4, Problem 2: Robot localization using particle filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture we have learned particle filtering, which can be interpreted as a Monte Carlo method for Hidden Markov Models. In this exercise, we learn how to use this method to track a moving robot's position over time. In this setting, we have access to the steering and velocity control inputs. We also have sensors that measure the distances to visible landmarks. The basic principle of particle filtering is then that the population of particles tracks the high-likelihood regions of the robot's position.\n",
